# Basic-GLSL-Shaders
Four basic GLSL shaders that I made as part of my graphics class. One that simply reflects and refracts like a globe of glass, one that has the same look but wobbles with perlin noise to simulate a wobbling ball of water, one that simulates cartoon shading with black and white, and one that makes waving grass using three planes and a texture.

The main program itself was given to us by our professor Scott Fielder for use in his class.

You can switch which object and textures are being loaded by going to the Source Files folder, then the Scenes folder, then the Scene1.cpp file and changing the whatObject variable to be equal to one of the other numbers given as examples.
